About

This plugin adds Hypothes.is integration to the public article view of OJS,
permitting annotation and commenting.

It currently supports commenting on HTML galleys. For PDF support, see the note
below.

License

This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file
COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

System Requirements
-------------------
This plugin has been developed for OJS 3.0.x and may not work with other
versions.

Installation
------------
This plugin is probably available for quick installation in the OJS Plugin
Gallery. To install it there, go to Settings > Website > Plugins and open the
Plugin Gallery.

If you cannot use the Plugin Gallery, you can also install the plugin as follows:
 - Using the Journal Manager's "system plugins" area, upload the plugin .tar.gz
   file into OJS.
 - as Journal Manager, go into the "System Plugins" page and enable the plugin.
 - Read an HTML article in the public reader interface of OJS and verify that
   the Hypothes.is tool is embedded.

In order to support Hypothes.is with OJS's PDF.js-based PDF reader, you'll need
to apply a patch to the version of PDF.js that's included in that plugin. The
patch is currently available at:

https://github.com/hypothesis/pdf.js-hypothes.is/commit/ab3f25

To apply it...

    cd plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer/pdf.js
    patch -p2 < /path/to/ab3f25.diff
